# Changelog

## [0.2] - 2024-07-02

### Added

- Added the util::bytevector class to work with big-endian data (e.g.
  MIDI files).
- Added a test for the util::bytevector class.
- Renamed the cfg::inifile class to "inisections" because it was
  misleading.
- Added an actual cfg::inifile class to extend cfg::configfile.
- Beefed up the ini\_test application to write and parse a sample
  configuration file.
- Added diagrams to clarify the hierarchy.
- Split the inisections module into inimanager, inisection, and
  inisections modules. The inimanager handles multiple INI files with
  multiple INI sections.
- Added a "multi-parser" to cover multiple INI-style files for an
  application.
- Tightened up the interactions between command-line parsing and INI
  configuration files. Support command-line options over multiple
  INI files.
- Improved the range checking for integer/float options.
- Added display/access for parsing error messages.
- Added "recents" as a kind of option, and added a class called
  recent (taken from Seq66) to handle them.

### Fixed

- Fixes related to util::bytevector.
- Many fixes found while implementing the inifile class.
- Fixed major bugs in handling basic command-line parsing and options.
- Refactored the creation of the parser.

### Changed

- Changed the new inimap class name to inimanager.
- Added "no-inline-functions" to meson.build; does not work, though.
- No changes unrelated to util::bytevector, except for updating the
  relevant meson.build files.

# Changelog

## [0.4] - 2025-03-08

### Added

- To do.

## [0.3] - 2025-03-02

### Added

- File functions: file\_status(), file\_read\_lines(),
  get\_wildcards(), file\_list\_copy().
- Message functions: xxx\_printf() functions for formatting
  errors, warnings, status, and other human-readable messages.
- String functions: Many additions such as is\_npos().
- Config-file functions: Add function to parse and write
  list sections and session files.
- Macros: CSTR() and V() to distinguish usage of
  std::string::c\_str() in legacy vs. cfg66 functions.
- Add the potext library as an optional subproject.
- Added a test of read/write for session configuration.

### Fixed

- Functions: strcompare() declared incorrectly.

## [0.2] - 2024-08-05

### Added

- Added the util::bytevector class to work with big-endian data (e.g.
  MIDI files). Added a test for the util::bytevector class.
- Renamed the cfg::inifile class to "inisections" because it was
  misleading.
- Added an actual cfg::inifile class to extend cfg::configfile.
- Beefed up the ini\_test application to write and parse a sample
  configuration file.
- Added diagrams to clarify the hierarchy.
- Split the inisections module into inimanager, inisection, and
  inisections modules. The inimanager handles multiple INI files with
  multiple INI sections. Added the ini\_set\_test program to test
  the inimanager and its associates.
- Added a "multi-parser" to cover multiple INI-style files for an
  application.
- Tightened up the interactions between command-line parsing and INI
  configuration files. Support command-line options over multiple
  INI files.
- Improved the range checking for integer/float options.
- Added display/access for parsing error messages.
- Added "recents" as a kind of option, and added a class called
  "recent" (adapted from Seq66) to handle them.
- Added some useful functions to the strfunctions module.

### Fixed

- Fixes related to util::bytevector.
- Many fixes found while implementing the inifile class.
- Fixed major bugs in handling basic command-line parsing and options.
- Refactored the creation of the parser.

### Changed

- Changed the type of options\_kind from std::string to cfg::options::kind.
  This change required all cfg::options::spec initializers to be modified.
  Vim users can use this command on each affected line:
  :.s/"\(.*\)"/options::kind::\1/   and then use the & command to repeat
  that for each affected line.
- Changed the new inimap class name to inimanager.
- Added "no-inline-functions" to meson.build; does not work, though.
- Upgraded the --help output, including color highlighting.
- No changes unrelated to util::bytevector, except for updating the
  relevant meson.build files.

### Removed

- Nothing

## [0.1.1] - 2024-04-30

### Added

- No significant added code.

### Fixed

- The HAVE macros were updated.
- Cfg66 can now be used as a sub-project.
- Fixed the build dependencies and build setup.

### Changed

- The HAVE macros were updated.
- Updated the cfg66.wrap file.
- Added --install and --uninstall options to work.sh. The latter is
  not completely effective at removing all installed files, however.
- Renamed the .pc file to libcfg66.pc.

### Removed

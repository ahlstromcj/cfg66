2023-07-16 to 2023-07-24

This file lists only the high-priority features and fixtures we need
to do for Cfg66.

ini_test_cpp:

    -   Why are not the addition global option codes appearing in
        the code-list? See inimanager ctor. Also find where
        code_mappings().insert() is called in multiparser.
        It only has 8 entries!
    -   Note/document the rules for descriptions; detect a final
        newline to avoid adding a blank line.
    -   Add processing to at least some of the options in
        ini_set_test.
    -   Add a [last-used-dir] value based on reading/writing.
    -   Add to the [recent-files] based on reading/writing.
    -   Add some fake ports to [midi-input], [midi-input-map],
        [midi-clock], and [midi-clock-map].

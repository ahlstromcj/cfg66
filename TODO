TODOs for the cfg66 library

This file lists only the high-priority features and fixtures we need
to do for Cfg66.

ini_test_cpp:

    -   Too many extra spaces after writing the "[Cfg66]" section to
        the "rc" file. This is due to an section of "rc" with
        name, description, and source_section that are empty.
        Why does this section occur?
    -   When writing the file, make sure the config-type is "rc" for the
        test.
    -   Make an additional way to add comment characters to the description,
        without removing the newlines or justifying.
    -   Add a [last-used-dir] value based on reading/writing.
    -   Add to the [recent-files] based on reading/writing.
    -   Add some fake ports to [midi-input], [midi-input-map],
        [midi-clock], and [midi-clock-map].

This file lists only the high-priority features and fixtures we need
to do for Cfg66.

ini_test_cpp:

    -   Add processing to at least some of the options in
        ini_set_test.
    -   Add a variable main-section name (besides "[Cfg66]") to
        configfile.
    -   In the ini_set_test for reading/writing, add processing of
        a "small" INI file to handle more than onte INI file.
    -   Add a [last-used-dir] value based on reading/writing.
    -   Add to the [recent-files] based on reading/writing.
    -   Add some fake ports to [midi-input], [midi-input-map],
        [midi-clock], and [midi-clock-map].
    -   Test specifying one port on the command line.
    -   Make sure filefunctions rigorously use UNIX path styles
        internally and externally.

[Cfg66]

# The main configuration data for Cfg66-compliant applications, similar
# to an MS-DOS INI file.
# 'config-type' indicates the kind of file and file extension.
# 'version' allows detection of older configuration files.
# 

config-type = "session"                 # The type of configuration file.
version = 0                             # Configuration file version.

[experiments]

# This section is just a bunch of dummies for some simple tests.
# By itself, it shows the output string for a list of described
# options. This description string is deliberately long to show
# how word-wrapping and commenting with '#' can work. Also note
# that white space such as newlines are converted to spaces for
# this purpose. Further note that this output can be dumped to
# a configuration file to save the settings. Lastly, note that,
# by default, options are output ordered alphabetically by their
# long option name.

[section-test]

# This "section" option shows how only one bald string is
# contained in a section option.
# 

This is actually a multi-line '[section]' value.
This is the second line of the [section] value.
Normally, this is the ONLY value in an [section] option.

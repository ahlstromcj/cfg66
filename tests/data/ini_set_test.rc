# with a more specific structure. We need to specify the config-type and
# the version.

[misc]

# A number of miscellaneous options. They fit into no obvious grouping.
# 
# 'sets-mode' affects set muting when moving to the next set. 'normal' leaves
# the next set muted. 'auto-arm' unmutes it. 'additive' keeps the previous set
# armed when moving to the next set. 'all-sets' arms all sets at once.
# 
# 'port-naming': 'short', 'pair', or 'long'. If 'short', the device name is
# shown. If it  is generic, the client name is added for clarity. If 'pair',
# the client:port number is prepended. If 'long', the full set of name items
# is shown. If port-mapping is active (now the default), this does not apply.
# 
# 'init-disabled-ports' is experimental. It tries live toggle of port state.

init-disabled-ports = true              # Experimental option; not recommended.
last-used-dir = "."
manual-ports = true                     # false by default
port-naming = "long"                    # Port amount-of-label showing.
reveal-ports = true                     # false by default
sets-mode = "auto-arm"

[midi-meta-events]

# Defines features of MIDI meta-event handling. Tempo events occur in the first
# track (pattern 0), but one can move them elsewhere. It changes where tempo
# events are recorded. The default is 0, the maximum is 1023. A pattern must
# exist at this number.

tempo-track = 99

[midi-input]

# These MIDI ports are for input and control. JACK's view: these are
# 'playback' devices. The first number is the bus, the second number is the
# input status, disabled (0) or enabled (1). The item in quotes is the full
# input bus name.

count = 0

[midi-input-map]

# Defines alternate port numbers for MIDI input ports. This table is similar
# to the [midi-clock-map] section, but the values are different:
# -2 = unavailable; 0 = not inputing; 1 = enabled for inputing.

count = 0

[midi-clock]

# These MIDI ports are for output/playback and display. JACK's view: these
# are 'capture' devices. The first line shows the count of output ports.
# Each line shows the bus number and clock status of that bus:
# 
#  -2 = The output port is not present on the system (unavailable).
#  -1 = The output port is disabled.
#   0 = MIDI Clock is off. The output port is enabled.
#   1 = MIDI Clock on; Song Position and MIDI Continue are sent.
#   2 = MIDI Clock Modulo.
# 
# With Clock Modulo, clocking doesn't begin until song position reaches the
# start-modulo value [midi-clock-mod-ticks]. Ports that are unavailable
# (because another portapplication, e.g. Windows MIDI Mapper, has exclusive
# access to the device) are displayed ghosted.
# 

count = 0

[midi-clock-map]

# Patterns use buss numbers, not names. This table provides virtual bus numbers
# that match real devices and can be stored in each pattern. The bus number
# is looked up in this table, the port nick-name is retrieved, and the true
# bus number is obtained and used. Thus, if the ports change order in the MIDI
# system, the pattern will use the proper port. The short nick-names work in
# ALSA or JACK (a2jmidid bridge).

count = 0

[midi-clock-mod]

# 'ticks' provides the Song Position (16th notes) at which clocking begins if
# the bus is set to MIDI Clock Mod setting.
# 
# 'record-by-channel' allows the master MIDI bus to record/filter incoming MIDI
# data by channel, adding each new MIDI event to the pattern that is set to
# that channel. Option adopted from the Seq32 project at GitHub.

record-by-channel = true
ticks = 128

[metronome]

# Provides for before-playback count-in and recording, and a metronome that
# can play any sound on the major and minor beats.

[interaction-method]

# Sets mouse usage for drawing/editing patterns. 'Fruity' mode is NOT
# supported. Other settings are available:
# 
# 'snap-split' enables splitting song-editor triggers at a snap position
# instead of in its middle. Split is done by a middle-click or ctrl-left click.
# 
# 'double-click-edit' allows double-click on a slot to open it in a pattern
# editor. Set it to false if you don't like how it works.

[jack-transport]

# 'transport-type' enables JACK Transport.
# 'none':        No JACK Transport in use.
# 'slave':       Use JACK Transport as Slave.
# 'master':      Attempt to serve as JACK Transport Master.
# 'conditional': Serve as JACK master if no JACK master exists.
# 
# 'song-start-mode' playback is either Live, Song, or Auto:
# 'live': Muting & unmuting of loops in the main window.
# 'song': Playback uses Song (performance) editor data.
# 'auto': If the loaded tune has song triggers, use Song mode.
# 
# 'jack' sets/unsets JACK MIDI, separate from JACK transport.
# 
# 'auto-connect' sets connecting to ALSA/JACK ports found. Default = true; use
# false to have a session manager make the connections.
# 
# 'jack-use-offset' attempts to calculate timestamp offsets to
# improve accuracy at high-buffer sizes. Still a work in progress.
# 
# 'jack-buffer-size' allows for changing the frame-count, a power of 2.

[auto-option-save]

# 'auto-save-rc' sets automatic saving of the  'rc' and other files. If set,
# many command-line settings are saved to configuration files.
# 
# 'old-triggers' saves triggers in a format compatible with Seq24. Otherwise,
# triggers are saved with an additional 'transpose' setting.
# 
# 'save-old-mutes' saves mute-groups as long legacy values instead of bytes.

[last-used-dir]

# Holds the name of the directory for the last MIDI song that was loaded.

"bogus/cfg66"

[recent-files]

# The most recently-loaded MIDI files. 'full-paths' = true means to show the
# full file-path in the menu. The most recent file (top of list) can be loaded
# via 'load-most-recent' at startup.

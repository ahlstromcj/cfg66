[Cfg66]

# This file holds the main configuration data for Cfg66-compliant
# applications. It follows a format similar to the old INI files of MS-DOS.
#
# 'config-type' can be used to make sure the right kind of file is in use.
# 'version' helps the application to detect older configuration files. See
# the 'session' specification for the common 'quiet' and 'verbose' options.

config-type = "rc"                      # The type of configuration file.
version = 1                             # Configuration file version.

[comments]

# The [comments] section holds user documentation for this file. The first
# empty, hash-commented, or tag (section) line ends the comment.
#  
# Use a space for line breaks as done in the line above.

Add your comment block here. Comments are a 'section' option. For 'section'
options, there are no 'variable = value' lines, just lines that are read
as is.
 
This is the next paragraph, separated from the above with a line blank
except for a single space.

[experiments]

# This section is just a bunch of dummies for some simple tests.  By itself,
# it shows the output string for a list of described options. This
# description string is deliberately long to show how word-wrapping and
# commenting with '#' can work. Also note that white space such as newlines
# are converted to spaces for this purpose. Further note that this output
# can be dumped to a configuration file to save the settings. Lastly, note
# that, by default, options are output ordered alphabetically by their long
# option name.

[section-test]

# This "section" option shows how only one bald string is contained
# in a section option.

This is the new version of the section value.
This is the second line of the new [section] value.

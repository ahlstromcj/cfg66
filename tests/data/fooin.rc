[Cfg66]

# This file holds the main configuration data for Cfg66-compliant
# applications. It follows a format similar to the old INI files of MS-DOS.
# 'config-type' can be used to make sure the right kind of file is in use.
# 'version' helps the application to detect older configuration files. See the
# 'session' specification for the common 'quiet' and 'verbose' options.

config-type = "session"                 # The type of configuration file.
version = 0                             # Configuration file version.

[experiments]

# This section is just a bunch of dummies for some simple tests. By itself, it
# shows the output string for a list of described options. This description
# string is deliberately long to show how word-wrapping and commenting with
# '#' can work. Also note that white space such as newlines are converted to
# spaces for this purpose. Further note that this output can be dumped to a
# configuration file to save the settings. Lastly, note that, by default,
# options are output ordered alphabetically by their long option name.

[section-test]

# This "section" option shows how only one bald string is contained in a
# section option.

This is actually a multi-line '[section]' value.
This is the second line of the [section] value.
Normally, this is the ONLY value in an [section] option.
